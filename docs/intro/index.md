## How It Works: A Step-by-Step Flow
### `Step 1`: Define Your Use Case
Identify the business process, task, or interface you want to digitize or automate.

### `Step 2`: Model Processes & Workflows
Use the visual process designer to map out your workflow:
- Define stages (e.g., Approval, Review, Execution).
- Set triggers, conditions, and decision points.

### `Step 3`: Configure Interfaces & User Journeys
- Drag and drop components to create forms, pages, or dashboards.
- Add input fields, dropdowns, buttons, and interactive elements.
- Preview the user journey and refine as needed.

### `Step 4`: Automate Tasks & Processes
- Assign automation to steps (e.g., send reminders, generate documents, update records).
- Configure robots for low-value tasks.

### `Step 5`: Generate Outputs
- Set up document templates for automatic generation.
- Define dashboard views for real-time tracking and insights.

### `Step 6`: Test & Deploy
- Test the application in a sandbox environment.
- Refine workflows, interfaces, or automation as needed.
